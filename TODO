Things to do to improve OML:

49) Move IsSorted to sort.h.

50) All subscriptors need T op(int) const.
	Why????

54)
	begin() and end() just return pointers?
	If we do the latter then it will be impossible MatrixRow and MatrixColumn
	to have iterators becuase at least one of them will have a non trivial op++.
	(They don't have iterators now!)
	Let's hold off on this one.	

Done 55) Make it complient with gcc 3.20, while maintaining backwards compatibility with gcc 2.95.
  
56) Move random number implementation details out of the headers.

		make -j4	make check -j4		run tests only	
gcc 2.95	1:28		2:05			0:33
gcc 3.20	3:41		3:20			0:25


April/2003 Timings for OPT=-O2 -NDEBUG april 2003	
				make -j2	make check -j2		run tests only	
gcc 2.95			1:07		1:37			0:10
gcc 3.2.3 			3:11		3:05			0:09
gcc 3.2.3 -finline-limit=1000			3.58			0.09
gcc 3.2.3 -finline-limit=100000			4:21			0.09
gcc 3.2.3 -finline-limit=100			2:52			0.31

Looks hopeless right now, don't want to deal with a 3 fold increase in compile times.
