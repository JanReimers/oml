Disconnect HEAD in git
    Just do this:

    git checkout master
    Or, if you have changes that you want to keep, do this:

    git checkout -b temp
    git checkout -B master temp

Work list:
    Done: Organize header include order for indexable, and matalg headers
        Done: Move chunks of matalg into Matrix and Diag matrix headers.
    Done: Default constructors should create zero size Vectors and Matrices.
    Done: Git rid of Matrix
    Done: Rename DMatrix to Matrix
    Done: Fix up unit tests for double (forget int float for now)
        Done: Vector
        Done Matrix
            Done Need more mix types
        Done DiagonalMatrix
        Done SymmetricMatrix
        SparseMatrix
    Move SparseMatrix into OML
    Round out LAPack and Arpack wrappers and move everything to oml
    Done: Is it possible to simplify expression templates with C++17? (yes!)
    Done Beef up Diagonal matrices.
    Done: add fabs for complex matrices and stop using abs
    Done: use int_64 throughout
    F(A-B) for work where F(const Matrix<T>&)
    Initialize value as third argument, Loose to FIll routines
        This has consequences
            1) Vector<dcmplx>(10,0.5) -> uses the Vector(int low,int high) constructor
            2) Vector<Matrix<whatever>> breaks to compile on the Fill calls.
                We can solve by keeping everything inline & dont use FillType=None
    Does explicit on the contructors help with anything?
    use class enums
    Use constructor delegation
        Done: Vector
        Matrix
        DiagonalMatrix
        SymmetricMatrix
    Create vector T*, set num owners=2
        Not possible with std::vector instead of cow_array
    Failed idea:  I was hoping that Rvalue Ref-qualified overloaded operator like
        operator()(int i, int j) && and could get picked when a non-const matrix is being used as
        an R-value like
            Matrix<double> A(5,5);
            double a12=A(1,2); //should pick out operator()(int i, int j) && instead of operator()(int i, int j) &
        but g++ at least is not cooperating, it always picks up the lvalue version operator()()&
        Maybe its worth posting a minimal sample on stack exchange.
